# Echo Repository!
  
Want to make a public package for Echo?  
[View The WIKI to learn how!](https://github.com/proxikal/EchoRepository/wiki)  
  
## What is this?
This is where all the **system** pre-defined functions for Echo's A.R.S Will be held.  
What do you mean!!: You see the `messages.json` You can import that file in your a.r.s rules  
for example you can add
```php
.auto &.pmtest={init}
import "system/messages"
call::UserMessageSend({rawid}, Testing the import PMS!);
```
Now there are two ways to use the above rule.  
**1.** just type `.pmtest` and watch the magic happen.  
**2.** Mention a user with the command to have echo pm them the message!  
example: `.pmtest @User` When you use `import "system/anything"` it leads to this repo!  
  
## Predfined ..what??
Yeah, that's right. **Pre-defined** functions. A new feature in the Echo 2.0 A.R.S System.  
Allows users to easily store template rules.  

## Function Example
Let's start you off with a simple one, this function has no parameters.
```php
.define func HelloUser():Hello {/user}!!
```
  
Looks easy enough right? Now when you type that it will be stored in your guilds `Defines` object.  
Allowing you to easily access that function in your server with any A.R.S Rule.  
Let's give you an example how to use the function in our A.R.S.  
```php
.auto .hello={init}
call::HelloUser();
```
Yay! Now when you type `.hello` you will get your `pre-defined` function's response.
  
## More Advanced Example
The function below has two parameters. And will redirect their message to a channel.
```php
.define func HelloUser(ChannelID, Message):{redirect:{0}}{1}
```
Alright now before we teach you how to use this function in your A.R.S Rules let's explain..  
What we're doing here is creating a function with Two parameters. And than defining those parameters  
using the `{0}` for ChannelID and `{1}` for Message.  
When you think about it, it's pretty simple. You can have an unlimited amount of parameters in your function  
**However** You need to define those parameters with a `{num}` counterpart.  
Meaning..If you have a function with 4 paramters `HelloUser(Param1, Params2, Params3, Params4)`  
you will need to define them in the functions response as such `{0}=Param1`, `{1}=Params2`, `{2}=Params3`, `{3}=Params4`  
  
Alright now let's learn how to use that function in the A.R.S Rules.  
Technically there are a few different ways to do this, let's try to cover them!  
This one will post a `pre-defined` message to a channel the user types with the command.  
```php
.auto &.hello {params}={init}
call::HelloUser({params}, This message is pre-defined);
```
Ok, now if the user types `.hello CHANNELID-HERE` the predfined message will be sent to the channel id they typed.  
Now let's switch it up, do the opposite!  
```php
.auto &.hello {params}={init}
call::HelloUser(1268555466456789, {params});
```
Ok now when someone types `.hello What is up guys!` Their message will be redirected to the channel: `1268555466456789`  
And since the `{redirect}` key requires the channel id. We need to make sure to place the channel ID not the name.
  
# What does this mean for Echo?
Well this is going to open many doors. For people of all levels in A.R.S  
For now let's focus on what we'll be doing called `Imports` you will see `messages.json` in this repo  
you can try it by adding an A.R.S Rule below (Change the channel id to yours!)
```php
.auto &.test={init}
import "proxikal/EchoRepository/messages"
call::RedirectMessage(45645645678943123, Testing the imports redirect!);
```
Or you can use the global name for this repo, which is easier to remember  
`import "system/messages"`  

Awesome huh! Multiple imports will be available in time. but we will need to change the imports system  
so don't get `too` comfortable with it just yet.  
  
### Add your own Imports!
We will be accepting (Good full) packages to place in this repo `systems/...`  
And we'll be adding our own as well! However our Imports system only allows for one import!  
this could change, however we need to make sure if someone imports multiple packages  
IF they have conflicting function names, we need to force the user to define a package prefix.
